# Life in Weeks

This program using maths and f-Strings that tells us how many days, weeks, months we have left if we live until 90 years old.

It will take the user's current age as input and output a message with the remaining time in the following format:
You have x days, y weeks, and z months left.
Where x, y and z are replaced with the actual calculated numbers.

The link below https://waitbutwhy.com/2014/05/life-weeks.html gave me the idea to make an app for a next pet project, that will motivate people, fill their lives with impressions and emotions.
